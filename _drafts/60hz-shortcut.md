Step 2: Create a new 60hz profile
(use “Add…” button in the detailed resolutions of the app, then restart for the changes to apply)

Step 3: Mapping Hotkey (HRC)
HRC – HotKey Resolution Changer

Step 4: Create 60Hz profile
From the 2 profile’s in HRU, set the 2nd one as 60hz using the drop down list near it, then set a hotkey for both. (not possible to set the same hotkey for both, or the fn key)
ctrl+1 for 120hz (which is my native, it will work with your 165hz too) and ctrl+2 for 60hz.

60Hz refresh rate can be set using the assigned hotkey
